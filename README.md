# Neural Compilers

Code for building a neural compiler (a Transformer that learns to translate C to x86), from "Learning C to x86 Translation: An Experiment in Neural Compilation" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07639).

**Warning: The code is not properly documented and organized since this is an ongoing effort.**
